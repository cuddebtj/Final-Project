## Project due date: 7/23/2020, at 5:00 PM EST
## You must be available during the class time to present your project.



#### Presentation structure (7-10 min)
- Share your URL
- What is your project?
- Demo
- What were the hurdles (Perhaps technology issues)? 
- Any advice that you can give to your classmates
- QA

#### Overview
Let's kick it up a notch and build a modular and modern application using Python.
You must submit your full project proposal and dataset to your instructional team by 6:00 PM EST Thursday (7/16/2020).
Show us what you've got!

NOTE: Send us a Slack DM message, CC: Britt, Vonn, and Suresh

## Requirements

#### Data Science project must:
- Be a working, interactive, Python application
- Must include grouping and data aggregation, and standard functions such as max, min, sum, and std etc
- Must have at least 2 .apply methods()
- Must have data visualization 

NOTE: ***YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RECREATE PROJECT 1 OR PROJECT 2***

#### Your code must:
- Be properly indented  
- Be written with semantic Python code  
- Be commented for the other developers    

## Necessary Deliverables

#### A Killer Project Proposal:
- What is your project is all about
- What are the three classes (or more), be ready to discuss it's functionality
- If it's Data Science project, you must provide the link to the data set prior to the project approval

#### For the project:
- Regadless of your what type of application you intend to build it must have a GitHub repo(USE YOUR PERSONAL GITHUB REPO)
- Data Science project must include the dataset in the GitHub repo along with the Jupyter Notebook
- DO NOT UPLOAD THE PROJECT FILES TO GITHUB, you must push your code the GitHub as you build the application

## A Note on Plagiarism
Take a moment to re-familiarize yourself with the [plagiarism policy](https://git.generalassemb.ly/PYTH-5-19/final-project/blob/master/Plagiarism.MD), specifically on using work you find online and on work you do with other students.
